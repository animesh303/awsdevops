- [ ] DynamoDB tables (for NoSQL data)
- [ ] EFS (for shared file storage)
- [ ] Other storage services

### 2.3 API & Networking

- [x] VPC configuration
- [x] Load Balancers (ALB for web tier)
- [ ] API Gateway (for REST/HTTP APIs)
- [ ] CloudFront (for CDN)
- [ ] Other networking services

### 2.4 Security & Access

- [x] IAM roles and policies
- [x] Security Groups
- [x] KMS (for encryption)
- [ ] Cognito (for user authentication)
- [ ] Secrets Manager
- [ ] Other security services

### 2.5 Monitoring & Logging

- [x] CloudWatch (for monitoring)
- [ ] X-Ray (for tracing)

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Programming Language

- [x] Python
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Other: **___**

### 3.2 Data Requirements

- **Data Input**: Web application user requests, form submissions, API calls
- **Data Processing**: Business logic processing, data validation, user authentication
- **Data Output**: Web pages, API responses, reports, file downloads
- **Data Volume**: Expected moderate traffic with growth potential

### 3.3 API Requirements

- **Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for application functionality
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with secure login

## 4. Infrastructure Requirements

### 4.1 Environment Configuration

- **Development Environment**: Required for dev testing
- **Staging Environment**: Required for pre-production testing
- **Production Environment**: Required for live deployment

### 4.2 Resource Sizing

- **EC2 Instances**: 
  - Web Tier: t3.medium (2 instances minimum for HA)
  - App Tier: t3.large (2 instances minimum for HA)
- **RDS Instance**: db.t3.medium with Multi-AZ deployment
- **S3 Storage**: Standard storage class with lifecycle policies
- **Network Bandwidth**: Expected moderate traffic with auto-scaling capability

### 4.3 High Availability

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Required for production
- **Backup Strategy**: Daily automated backups for RDS, S3 versioning enabled
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour

## 5. Architecture Details

### 5.1 Three-Tier Architecture

**Presentation Tier (Web Tier)**
- EC2 instances running web servers (Apache/Nginx)
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Auto Scaling Group for high availability
- Security Groups allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic

**Application Tier (Logic Tier)**
- EC2 instances running application servers
- Private subnets for security
- Auto Scaling Group for performance
- Security Groups allowing traffic only from web tier

**Data Tier (Database Tier)**
- RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL instance
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Private subnets for security
- Security Groups allowing traffic only from app tier
- S3 bucket for file storage and backups

### 5.2 Network Architecture

- **VPC**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets
- **Subnets**: 
  - Public subnets for web tier (2 AZs)
  - Private subnets for app tier (2 AZs)
  - Private subnets for database tier (2 AZs)
- **Internet Gateway**: For public internet access
- **NAT Gateway**: For private subnet internet access
- **Route Tables**: Proper routing configuration
