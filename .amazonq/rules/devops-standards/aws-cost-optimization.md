# AWS Cost Optimization

## Purpose

Ensures cost-effective AWS resource usage through proper sizing, right-sizing, and optimization strategies while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Instructions

- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Explorer for cost analysis and optimization recommendations (ID: USE_COST_EXPLORER)
- ALWAYS implement proper resource tagging for cost allocation and tracking (ID: RESOURCE_TAGGING)
- ALWAYS use AWS Budgets for cost monitoring and alerting (ID: USE_AWS_BUDGETS)
- ALWAYS implement proper auto-scaling for EC2 instances and other scalable resources (ID: AUTO_SCALING)
- ALWAYS use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for predictable workloads (ID: RESERVED_INSTANCES)
- ALWAYS implement proper S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization (ID: S3_LIFECYCLE)
- ALWAYS use Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible workloads (ID: SPOT_INSTANCES)
- ALWAYS implement proper RDS instance right-sizing and storage optimization (ID: RDS_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Trusted Advisor for cost optimization recommendations (ID: USE_TRUSTED_ADVISOR)
- ALWAYS implement proper Lambda function optimization and cold start reduction (ID: LAMBDA_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Compute Optimizer for EC2 and EBS optimization (ID: USE_COMPUTE_OPTIMIZER)
- ALWAYS implement proper CloudWatch logging retention policies (ID: LOG_RETENTION_POLICIES)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for unusual spending patterns (ID: COST_ANOMALY_DETECTION)
- ALWAYS implement proper data transfer optimization and CDN usage (ID: DATA_TRANSFER_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Categories for detailed cost allocation (ID: USE_COST_CATEGORIES)
- ALWAYS implement proper EBS volume optimization and GP3 usage (ID: EBS_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost and Usage Reports for detailed cost analysis (ID: USE_CUR)
- ALWAYS implement proper DynamoDB capacity optimization and on-demand billing (ID: DYNAMODB_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Allocation Tags for detailed cost tracking (ID: COST_ALLOCATION_TAGS)
- ALWAYS implement proper S3 storage class optimization (ID: S3_STORAGE_CLASSES)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Explorer with proper filters and groupings (ID: COST_EXPLORER_FILTERS)
- ALWAYS implement proper CloudFront optimization and caching strategies (ID: CLOUDFRONT_OPTIMIZATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost and Billing Dashboard for cost visibility (ID: USE_BILLING_DASHBOARD)
- ALWAYS implement proper resource scheduling for non-production environments (ID: RESOURCE_SCHEDULING)
- ALWAYS use AWS Cost Optimization Hub for centralized optimization (ID: USE_COST_OPTIMIZATION_HUB)

## Priority

Medium

## Error Handling

- If cost optimization conflicts with performance requirements, document the trade-off and get approval
- If Reserved Instances are not suitable, implement alternative cost optimization strategies
- If auto-scaling cannot be implemented, document the limitation and implement manual scaling procedures
- If cost monitoring tools are not available, implement basic cost tracking and plan for enhancement
- If optimization recommendations are not feasible, document the business justification and implement alternative measures
