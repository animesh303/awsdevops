# AWS CI/CD Pipeline

## Purpose

Defines standardized CI/CD pipeline practices for AWS deployments using GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, and related services to ensure reliable, automated, and secure deployments.

## Instructions

- ALWAYS use GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD platform for AWS deployments (ID: USE_GITHUB_ACTIONS)
- ALWAYS implement proper environment separation (dev/staging/prod) with separate deployment pipelines (ID: ENVIRONMENT_SEPARATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeBuild for build processes with proper caching and optimization (ID: USE_CODEBUILD)
- ALWAYS implement proper secret management using GitHub Secrets and AWS Secrets Manager (ID: SECRET_MANAGEMENT)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeDeploy for application deployments with blue-green or rolling deployments (ID: USE_CODEPLOY)
- ALWAYS implement proper testing stages: unit tests, integration tests, and security scans (ID: TESTING_STAGES)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline for complex multi-stage deployments (ID: USE_CODEPIPELINE)
- ALWAYS implement proper infrastructure validation using terraform plan and terraform validate commands (ID: INFRASTRUCTURE_VALIDATION)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeArtifact for artifact storage and dependency management (ID: USE_CODEARTIFACT)
- ALWAYS implement proper rollback procedures and automated rollback triggers (ID: ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeStar for project management and CI/CD orchestration when appropriate (ID: USE_CODESTAR)
- ALWAYS implement proper approval gates for production deployments (ID: APPROVAL_GATES)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeCommit for source code management when required (ID: USE_CODECOMMIT)
- ALWAYS implement proper notification systems using SNS and Slack/Teams integration (ID: NOTIFICATION_SYSTEMS)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodeGuru for code quality analysis and security scanning (ID: USE_CODEGURU)
- ALWAYS implement proper deployment strategies: canary, blue-green, or rolling deployments (ID: DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGIES)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline with proper IAM roles and least privilege access (ID: PIPELINE_SECURITY)
- ALWAYS implement proper artifact versioning and tagging (ID: ARTIFACT_VERSIONING)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline with proper error handling and retry mechanisms (ID: ERROR_HANDLING)
- ALWAYS implement proper monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures (ID: PIPELINE_MONITORING)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline with proper environment-specific configurations (ID: ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGS)
- ALWAYS implement proper security scanning using AWS Inspector and third-party tools (ID: SECURITY_SCANNING)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline with proper artifact encryption and access controls (ID: ARTIFACT_SECURITY)
- ALWAYS implement proper performance testing and load testing in the pipeline (ID: PERFORMANCE_TESTING)
- ALWAYS use AWS CodePipeline with proper logging and audit trails (ID: PIPELINE_LOGGING)

## Priority

High

## Error Handling

- If GitHub Actions is not available, use AWS CodePipeline as the primary CI/CD platform
- If CodeBuild is not suitable, use alternative build tools but maintain AWS integration
- If approval gates cannot be implemented, document the risk and implement alternative controls
- If rollback procedures are not feasible, implement alternative recovery mechanisms
- If security scanning tools are not available, implement basic security checks and plan for enhancement
