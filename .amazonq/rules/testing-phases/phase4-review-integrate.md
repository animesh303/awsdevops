# Phase 4: Review & Integrate

Detailed steps are in `testing-phases/blueprint.md#phase-4-%E2%80%93-review-%26-integrate`.

**Key actions**
- Reload prior artifacts (plan, tests, execution logs, coverage) plus CI/CD context to determine next steps.
- Summarize overall quality (coverage, failures, gaps), outline integration or workflow updates, and note required follow-up tickets/action items.
- Capture the final recommendation + next steps in `.test-docs/testing-summary.md` or the plan, log the approval prompt in `.test-docs/audit.md`, wait for confirmation, update `.test-docs/test-state.md`, and remind the user to commit the artifacts.
