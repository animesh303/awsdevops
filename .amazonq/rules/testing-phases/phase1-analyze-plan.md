# Phase 1: Analyze & Plan

Detailed instructions now live in `testing-phases/blueprint.md#phase-1-%E2%80%93-analyze-%26-plan`.

**Key points**
- Load `.test-docs/test-state.md`, inspect source + existing tests/coverage, and capture findings (e.g., `codebase-analysis.md`, `existing-tests-inventory.md`) only when they add value.
- Define test objectives, scope, coverage targets, tooling, environments, and dependencies in `.test-docs/test-plan.md`, referencing the appropriate language standards files.
- Log the Phase‑1 approval prompt in `.test-docs/audit.md`, wait for confirmation, update `test-state.md`, and remind the user to commit the plan artifacts.
