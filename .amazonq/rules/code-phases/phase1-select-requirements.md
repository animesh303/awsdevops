# Phase 1: Select Requirements

Full instructions: `code-phases/blueprint.md#phase-1-%E2%80%93-select-requirements`.

**What to remember**
- `.jira-docs/requirements/` is the single source of truth. If it is empty, direct the user back to the JIRA workflow.
- Produce `available-requirements.md`, `requirements-selection.md`, the copied `{TICKET}_requirements.md`, and `{TICKET}-analysis.md` that records the chosen IAC tool, runtime/language, feature name, and tags.
- Confirm the relevant standards files exist (create TODOs or warnings if missing), log the approval prompt in `.code-docs/audit.md`, wait for confirmation, update `.code-docs/code-state.md`, and remind the user to commit the artifacts.
