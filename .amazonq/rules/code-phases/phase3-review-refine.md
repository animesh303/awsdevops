# Phase 3: Review & Refine

Detailed steps: `code-phases/blueprint.md#phase-3-%E2%80%93-review-%26-refine`.

**Key actions**
- Re-run lint/test/security checks, share clickable file links, and iterate on user feedback (only show files touched in each pass).
- Keep validation artifacts current, rerun tooling after every set of edits, and update `.code-docs/documentation/{feature}/` (README, deploy guide, env vars, troubleshooting).
- Log the Phase‑3 prompt in `.code-docs/audit.md`, capture the user’s approval, update `.code-docs/code-state.md`, and remind them to commit the refreshed artifacts.
