# Phase 3: Review & Confirm

See `cicd-phases/blueprint.md#phase-3-%E2%80%93-review-%26-confirm`.

**Key actions**
- Reload the plan, workflow file, validation checklist, and dependency notes; summarize findings for the user.
- Walk through job ordering, dependency handling, secrets, and rollback/error-handling expectations (link to the supporting docs as needed).
- Apply requested tweaks, rerun lint/validation, capture notes in `.cicd-docs/review-notes.md`, and present the updated workflow.
- Log the Phase‑3 prompt, wait for user approval, update `.cicd-docs/cicd-state.md`, and remind the user to commit artifacts.
