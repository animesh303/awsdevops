# Phase 1: Detect & Plan

See `cicd-phases/blueprint.md#phase-1-%E2%80%93-detect-%26-plan` for the streamlined checklist.

**Remember**
- Load `.cicd-docs/cicd-state.md`, `.cicd-docs/detection-plan.md`, and—when available—`.code-docs/requirements/` plus `.code-docs/artifact-mappings.json`.
- Discover languages, tools, environments, secrets, and dependency chains (use `workflow-dependency-handling.md` for details) and capture everything in the detection plan with checkboxes updated as you work.
- Log the Phase‑1 prompt in `.cicd-docs/audit.md`, wait for approval, update `cicd-state.md`, and remind the user to commit the planning artifacts.
