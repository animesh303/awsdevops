# Phase 4: Commit & Push

Follow `cicd-phases/blueprint.md#phase-4-%E2%80%93-commit-%26-push`.

**Reminders**
- Ask for explicit approval before touching git. If the user declines, document manual steps and exit.
- On approval, make sure git identity exists, stage `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` plus `.cicd-docs/`, commit with a descriptive message, and push to the active branch. Report any failures clearly.
- Log the interaction in `.cicd-docs/audit.md`, update `.cicd-docs/cicd-state.md`, and remind the user to commit manually when automation is skipped.
