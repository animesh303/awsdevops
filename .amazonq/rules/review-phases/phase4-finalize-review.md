# Phase 4: Finalize Review

Detailed guidance lives in `review-phases/blueprint.md#phase-4-%E2%80%93-finalize-review`.

**Summary**
- Reload all artifacts (findings, feedback, action items, recommendations) and consolidate them into the final review report + summary.
- Decide on approve / changes requested / blocked, ensure action-item tracking is current, and execute any GitHub MCP actions (comments/status updates) before closure.
- Log the Phase‑4 prompt in `audit.md`, capture the user’s final approval, update `review-state.md` (phase + overall status), and remind them to commit the artifacts.
