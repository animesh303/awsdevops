# Phase 3: Provide Feedback

See `review-phases/blueprint.md#phase-3-%E2%80%93-provide-feedback` for the condensed instructions.

**Essentials**
- Consolidate findings from `.review-docs/findings/`, prioritize, and update `findings-summary.md`.
- Produce the user-facing artifacts (`feedback.md` or `reports/review-report.md`, `action-items.md`, `recommendations.md`, optional inline comments via GitHub MCP).
- Keep feedback specific, constructive, and categorized (must/should/nice/positive).
- Log the Phase‑3 prompt in `audit.md`, wait for approval, update `review-state.md`, and remind the user to commit artifacts.
