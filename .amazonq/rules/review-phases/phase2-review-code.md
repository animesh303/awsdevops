# Phase 2: Review Code

See `review-phases/blueprint.md#phase-2-%E2%80%93-review-code` for the full checklist.

**Quick reference**
- Reload Phase 1 outputs, the target code, and relevant standards before reviewing.
- Log issues by category in `.review-docs/findings/{category}-findings.md`, citing the applicable standard and adding severity + evidence.
- Capture automated tool output in `automated-analysis-results.md` when used, and roll everything into `findings-summary.md`.
- Update plan checkboxes, log the Phase‑2 prompt in `audit.md`, wait for user approval, and mark progress in `review-state.md`.
