# Phase 3: Review, Iterate, & Update JIRA

See `jira-phases/blueprint.md#phase-3-%E2%80%93-review-%26-iterate--jira-update`.

**Key steps**
- Reload the ticket, requirements doc, open questions, Confluence metadata, and state; summarize context for the user.
- Apply requested edits, ensure Confluence reflects the latest content, and capture any outstanding clarifications in the doc.
- Use Atlassian MCP to comment on / transition the JIRA ticket based on user direction, logging the action in `.jira-docs/audit.md`.
- Update `.jira-docs/jira-state.md`, remind the user to commit the updated artifacts, and secure final confirmation before closing the workflow.
